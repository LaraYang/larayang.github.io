Welcome! My name is Lara Yang, and I graduated with a PhD in Organizational Behavior from [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/fields/organizational-behavior) in June 2024. My research broadly lies in the intersection of identity, culture, and social networks. Methodologically, I use a variety of methods, combining cutting-edge natural language processing models with surveys and field experiments.

At the GSB, I was a member of the [Computational Culture Lab](https://www.comp-culture.org/), which uses computational methods to systematically study and model culture. Prior to Stanford, I received my bachelorâ€™s degrees in Computer Science and Psychology from University of California, Berkeley, a masterâ€™s degree in Industrial Organizational Psychology from San Francisco State University, and interned as a software engineer and a research analyst along the way.
